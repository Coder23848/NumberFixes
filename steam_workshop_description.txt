    [*]Fixes a visual bug with shortcut pipes when the "show underwater shortcuts" Remix option is enabled.
    [*]Fixes a few (relatively minor) memory leaks associated with map and camera objects, as well as a larger one caused by opening the Remix menu.
    [*](hopefully) Fixes an issue that makes the game look pixelated in fullscreen mode under certain circumstances.
